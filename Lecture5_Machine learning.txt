Regression always used for numerical data
Classification always used for categorical data.

Garbage in = garbage out,   model selection/evaluation/hyperparameter tuning.


Steps for ML model training and deploying
1. Knowing the problem statement.
2. Collect data(secondary data) or you create data(primary data).
3. Data Preprocessing/Data wrangling/EDA.(Data scaling, Label encoding, removing outliers, dtypes of columns/fields etc)
4. Choosing ML model.(whether we are predicting numerical value(regression models) or categorical(classification models))
5. Splitting data into training(70-80%) and testing data(10-20%).
6. Performed training.
7. Evaluation of model(regression models have different evaluation metrics and classification models have different metrics).
8. After checking performance we tuned the models.
